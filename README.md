# Hireflash Back-End

Job Hiring Management System is a system that will help a company in hiring new employees. Job Hiring Management System was developed to facilitate access to managers, Human Resources officers and applicants throughout the hiring process. This can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Human Resources officers and managers during the hiring process by listing applicant feature for shortlisting and interview purposes. Furthermore, the existence of a centralized system can store all information related to the hiring process as well as reduce the cost of the company's expenses for the smoothness of the hiring process.

This repository is dedicated for Back-end source code where the algorithm, data operation and business process will be implemented using Node.js, Express, Prisma, Uploadcare, PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Features

## Lessons Learned

This project was purposed to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Parit Raja, Batu Pahat, Johor. This project is not easy enough to complete as I am challenge myself to build a system with complex data operation and business process. Using a multi-tier architecture or distributed services like front-end, back-end, databases and APIs, I can improve myself to be a system design and architecture expert. I am ready and open to face any challenges related to designing and architecturing the whole system.
